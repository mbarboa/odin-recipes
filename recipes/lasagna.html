        <li>1 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

        <li>2 cans (15 ounces each) tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef, sausage, onion, and garlic until well browned. Drain fat.
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
        Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
        In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
        Cover with foil, making sure to tent the foil so that it does not touch the cheese. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
